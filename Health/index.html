            <h3>How does your cultural background shape your ideas about your sexuality?</h3>

            <div class="question">
                <p>What role does family play?</p>

                    <p>How you were raised plays a big role in your ideas about sexuality. Children with LGBTQ parents, for example, are much more likely to identify as LGBTQ themselves. Because children are highly impressionable they often take on the attitudes and beliefs of their parents. This can be damaging however. Suppose someone feels that they identify in a way that their parents would disapprove of, this might make them unsure of themselves at best and can be incredibly traumatizing at worst.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>How do your friends factor in?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <img src="https://c0.wallpaperflare.com/preview/849/612/879/bonding-daylight-friends-friendship.jpg">
                    <p>Your friends have a huge effect on how you view the world, although probably not as much as your parents do, and so its no surprise when you act similar to them. This, if you have decent friends, is mostly a good thing. It allows you to move outside your bubble and see certain things from a different perspective. The downside of course, is when your friends pressure you into doing things without critical thinking. Both of these situations can change your attitude on sex and relationships.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>How does school affect sexual attitudes?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <img src="https://live.staticflickr.com/8447/7881939982_48fdda4a74_b.jpg">
                    <p>The degree to which school affects sexual attitudes varies from school to school. It all really depends on what sex-ed classes are taught if they are taught at all. Some schools encourage abstinence only, while others teach contraceptive methods. All these factors can have a heavy influence on the children being taught.</p>

            <div class="question">
                <p>How does your location and community influence this?</p>
                <div class="answer">
                    <img src="https://storage.needpix.com/rsynced_images/location-162102_1280.png">
                    <p>Location and community is a less important factor, but it likely influences the previous questions. Most people in a community, although less so now than before, share similar values and attitudes to most things. This means that your family and friends will typically share similar values, especially if you live in a smaller town. Because of this, you are in a sort of bubble where everyone has the same opinions, and thus so do you.</p>
